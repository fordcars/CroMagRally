## About Cro-Mag Rally

> In Cro-Mag Rally you are a speed-hungry caveman named Brog who races through the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages in primitive vehicles such as the Geode Cruiser, Bone Buggy, Logmobile, Trojan Horse, and many others. Brog has at his disposal an arsenal of primitive weaponry ranging from Bone Bombs to Chinese Bottle Rockets and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons.
> 
> In addition to single-player racing where one player races against the computer, there are also several different multi-player modes including Tag, Capture the Flag, and Survival. Up to four players can play on a single computer in split-screen mode.

CMR was released in 2000 by Pangea Software as a Mac exclusive, and it was a pack-in game on Macs that came out around that time.

## About this port

This is a port of the original OS 9 version of the game. It aims to provide the best way to experience CMR on today’s computers. It is an “enhanced” version insofar as it fixes bugs that may hinder the experience, and it brings in a few new features in keeping with the spirit of the original game.

Some of the new features include:
- Up to 4 players in split-screen multiplayer (up from 2 in the original).
- The UI is subtly animated and has been tweaked to be pleasant to look at on modern widescreens.
- Enable a timer in race modes to hone your racing skills, and keep track of your records in the all-new scoreboard!

I haven’t had time to restore NetSprockets multiplayer from the OS 9 version yet, but that may come in a later release.
